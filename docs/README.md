# Origami Finance

## Fortune Favors the Fold

Origami Finance ([https://origami.finance/](https://origami.finance/)) is a protocol that utilises available sources of liquidity to provide constant leverage for whitelisted liquid-staking strategies through a simple vault UX. The initial Origami v1 vaults launched in 2023 for GMX and GLP that automatically harvested yields to compound back into the underlying asset in the vault. The new v2 vaults will add the power of leverage -- also known as folding -- to the vaults by facilitating collateralized loans to increase effective exposure for the underlying asset and managing the leveraged position automatically. The liquidity will be sourced from external money markets such as Spark Finance as well as other Origami vaults like the oUSDC stablecoin vault.
